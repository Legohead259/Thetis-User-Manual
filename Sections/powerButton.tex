\section{Power button}

Pressing the power button while the device is switched off will switch the device on.  Pressing and holding the power button for two seconds while the device is switched on will switch the device off.

A timestamped notification message containing the string, "Button pressed." is sent each time the button is pressed.  This allows the button to function as a basic user input for real-time applications or as a means for marking events during data logging.  If the button is used in this way then the user must be careful not to hold the button for too long otherwise the device may be switched off unintentionally.
