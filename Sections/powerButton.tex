\section{Power button}
\label{sec:powerButton}

Pressing the power button while the device is switched off will switch the device on.  The power button must be held for two seconds to switch the device off.  A timestamped notification message containing the string, "Button pressed." is sent each time the button is pressed.  This allows the button to function as a basic user input for real-time applications or as a means marking events during data logging.
