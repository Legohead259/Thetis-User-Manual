% Data messages as sent continuously at the message rates configured in the device settings.  The message rate of each data message type is configured by a separate message rate divisor.  A message rate divisor is an positive integer that a sample rate is divided by to obtain the message rate.  For example, a sample rate rate of 400 Hz with a message rate divisor of 2 will result in a message rate of 200 messages per second.  A message rate divisor of 0 will disable the sending of that data message type.
% %
% The fixed samples rates for each data message type are listed in \Fref{tab:fixedSampleRatesForEachDataMessageType}.
% %
% See section \Fref{sec:dataMessages} for a description of each data message type.

% % If the message rate is less than the sample rate then samples will be averaged



% \subsection{Timestamps}

% The timestamp of a data message indicates the time at which a measurement was physically obtained.  For example, when an \ac{ADC} conversion completes.  Timestamps are therefore not affected by the sample rate tolerance or the latency of a communication channel.
% %
% A timestamp is the time since device start up with a resolution of 1 microsecond.
% %
% Applications that involve time-critical calculations such as numerical integration or interpolation should never infer timing from the nominal sample rate and should instead use the timestamp of each measurement.

% \subsection{Sample averaging}

% If a message rate divisor is greater than 1 then the measurements in each data message will be the average of $n$ samples where $n$ is the message rate divisor.  The timestamp will of the most recent sample.  For example, the inertial sample rate is 400 Hz, if the inertial message rate divisor is set to 8 then each inertial data message rate will be 50 messages/s and each data message will be the average of 8 samples with a timestamp of the 8th sample.

% Quaternion, rotation matrix, and Euler angle will not be averaged.

% \subsection{Synchronisation}

% Timestamp indicate the time since the device switched on longest ago.
