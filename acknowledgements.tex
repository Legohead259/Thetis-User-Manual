\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Acknowledgments} 

I would like to acknowledge and thank Dr. Sebastian Madgwick, his company xio-Technologies, and his staff for their efforts in developing small embedded data loggers.
The x-IMU3 became a major inspiration when it was announced earlier in 2023 and Seb was willing to chat with me about Thetis's design and its flaws.
He has also been open to me using the x-IMU3 API on my board and the x-IMU3 user manual as a basis for this manual.
His contributions and advice directly influenced version 2.0 of the firmware and the hardware revision F6.
I am grateful for his correspondence and look forward to continuing our discussions on a variety of ideas.
